The Java OOP course teaches the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), works with classes and objects, uses object-oriented modeling, and builds class hierarchies. The basic principles of OOP such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism are studied as well. We also went into the most commonly used design patterns. We paid attention to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD), the use of reflection.
The actual themes in the course:

### --- 1. Working with Abstraction
